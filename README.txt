DeskControlQt is a PyQt GUI written for control of my computer desk at home. Unless you've got the exact same setup as me, which includes custom built hardware, this probably isn't going to do you much good. However, I'm posting this to a public repository just because I like keeping everything in the same general place.

This GUI controls:

- The kitelight/trettio system, an Arduino based multi-channel PWM system that consists of 3 Ikea Trettio lights and 2 RGB boards (both controlled from one RGB channel).
- The rave spider, a single channel PWM controller using USBtiny - http://www.xs4all.nl/~dicks/avr/usbtiny/
- Python controls for the amBX ambient environment system, via libambx - http://www.github.com/qdot/libambx
- Controls for the LEDs in novint falcons, via libnifalcon - http://www.github.com/qdot/libnifalcon
